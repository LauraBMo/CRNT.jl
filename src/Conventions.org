* Design conventions
- The name of functions returning a function must end with 'of'
- Functions receiving arrays must recive Julia arrays and ones returning arrays, must return Julia arrays.
  We work in Julia, we use external tools to compute things, but we work in Julia.
  To esay interaction, functions eating or returning arrays must do it with Julia arrays.
